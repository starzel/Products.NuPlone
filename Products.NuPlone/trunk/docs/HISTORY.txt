  https://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7445, thanks cwainwright

- Added uninstall profile and hooked to GS
  [MatthewWilkes]

- Removed DIYPloneStyle tests as they were almost all broken.  Now tests 
  install, CSS and JS entries, and uninstall, but not modifications to default
  views, etc.  This is no loss as these tests didn't work anyway, as they 
  assumed a non-GS installation style.

- Installed nuplone.css with lower precedence than RTL.css after inserting
  RTL.css before ploneCustom.css.  Added test to check for RTL.css
  precendence over nuplone.css.
  Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7177
